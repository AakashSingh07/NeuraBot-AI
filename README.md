## 🧠 What is NeuraBot?

**NeuraBot AI** is a next-generation conversational assistant built using **Groq LLM**, **LangChain**, and **FAISS vector search** that delivers lightning-fast responses and intelligent document analysis.

Unlike basic chatbot projects, NeuraBot simulates a **real production-grade AI SaaS product** with memory, document retrieval, and premium UI.

This project demonstrates advanced AI engineering skills expected from modern:

👉 AI Engineers
👉 Data Scientists
👉 LLM Developers

---

## ⭐ Core Features

### ⚡ Ultra-Fast AI Responses

Powered by **Groq inference engine**, NeuraBot generates responses significantly faster than traditional LLM stacks.

✔ Real-time streaming output
✔ Natural conversations
✔ Low latency

---

### 📄 Chat With PDFs (RAG Technology)

Upload a document and NeuraBot will:

✅ Extract text
✅ Split into intelligent chunks
✅ Convert into embeddings
✅ Store vectors using FAISS
✅ Retrieve relevant context
✅ Generate highly accurate answers

This architecture dramatically reduces hallucinations and improves answer quality.

---

### 🧠 Session Memory

NeuraBot remembers conversation history during runtime, enabling contextual replies just like advanced commercial AI assistants.

---

### 🎨 Premium Startup-Level UI

Designed to look like a funded SaaS product:

* Dark enterprise theme
* Gradient typography
* Glass-style chat bubbles
* Clean spacing
* Modern layout

First impressions matter — especially to recruiters.

---

### 🔐 Secure API Architecture

Security is handled professionally:

✔ Environment variable support
✔ Streamlit secrets integration
✔ No exposed API keys

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
• Streamlit

**Backend:**
• Python

**AI / ML:**
• Groq LLM
• LangChain
• HuggingFace Embeddings
• FAISS Vector Database

**Document Processing:**
• PyPDFLoader

---

## ⚙️ Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add your Groq API key inside Streamlit secrets.

Start the app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

Most AI projects stop at building a chatbot.

NeuraBot goes further by implementing **production-style AI architecture**, including:

✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation
✅ Vector similarity search
✅ Secure key management
✅ Real-time streaming
✅ Professional UI

This is the type of project that instantly upgrades a developer portfolio.
